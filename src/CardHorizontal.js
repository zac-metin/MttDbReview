        Have you ever thought about how cool would it be if someone could tell you all your biggest leaks in your game? Learn about all the stuff that costs you the most EV? Too bad something like that is impossible? Well I have good news for you! That is exactly what I do. Instead of slow and innefective browsing through a single tournament hand history or explaining a specific hand, I am able to quickly go through a large sample of your hands and find the biggest repetitive leaks in your game and give you examples and explanation on how to fix those leaks. I coach even regs who regularly play in online  $530, $1k, $2k or even $5k and $10k tournaments.

I am also doing database reviews for Pocarr and for Three Amigos Staking.
