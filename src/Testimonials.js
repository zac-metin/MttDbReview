    <p className="SectionDetail">All these players from micro semi-regs to highstakes crushers received my database review (and many of them repeatedly) and were happy with it. There are no paid shills, no friends vouching for me just because we are friends, no outdated stuff from 2015 or any other bullshit. These are all real clients from the last year, most of them from last 6 months. Graphs (when avalaible) are added to give a little more idea about what they play, it's not supposed to show results before/after coaching.</p>
